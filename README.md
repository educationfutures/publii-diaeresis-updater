# Publii Diaeresis and Smart Quotes Updater

This Python script scans your [Publii](https://getpublii.com/) site's SQLite database and updates text inside posts to:

- Correctly apply **diaereses** (¨) to appropriate words (e.g., `cooperate` ➔ `coöperate`)
- Optionally replace **straight quotes** with **smart (curly) quotes** (e.g., `"example"` ➔ `“example”`)
- Fix common casual word usages (e.g., `webpage` ➔ `Web page`, `gonna` ➔ `going to`)

It ensures a more precise, formal, and polished English writing style across your site.

---

## Why use it?

English words that combine vowels across syllables (like "cooperate" or "reelect") traditionally used the diaeresis to clarify pronunciation. Restoring this usage improves readability and reflects a more careful, literate style.

Similarly, replacing straight quotation marks with smart (curly) quotes enhances typographic quality and aligns your site with professional publishing standards.

This script allows you to make these corrections **automatically and safely** across your Publii site.

---

## How it works

- Connects directly to your site's `db.sqlite` file.
- Scans the `posts` table, updating the `title` and `text` fields.
- Only words listed in the internal dictionary are replaced — no uncontrolled edits.
- Optionally replaces straight quotes with properly matched opening/closing smart quotes.
- Supports **dry-run mode** to preview changes without modifying your database.
- Automatically creates a backup (`db.sqlite.bak`) unless disabled.

## Example

Before:

> Cooperation and coordination are key to reevaluating our plans.

After:

> Coöperation and coördination are key to reëvaluating our plans.

## Installation and usage

### 1. Requirements

- Python 3.8 or newer (comes with SQLite support).

### 2. Setup

First, make sure to back up your Publii site as changes made are not reversible.

Clone this repository or download the script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/publii-diaeresis-updater.git
cd publii-diaeresis-updater
```

### 3. Configure

Open `diaeresis-updater.py` and modify this line to point to your database:

```python
sqlite_file = "/path-to-your-Publii-folder/sites/site-name/input/db.sqlite"
```

### 4. Run the script

Preview changes without modifying anything:

```bash
python3 diaeresis-updater.py --dry-run
```

Apply changes to your database:

```bash
python3 diaeresis-updater.py
```

Skip the backup (not recommended)

```bash
python3 diaeresis-updater.py --no-backup
```

Adjusting settings (optional)

Inside the script:

```python
apply_smart_quotes = True  # Set to False to disable smart quotes replacement
```

Example output:

```
📋 Words that would be changed (dry run):
- [posts][row 21][text]: website ➔ Web site
- [posts][row 33][text]: webpage ➔ Web page, smart quotes applied
- [posts][row 68][text]: website ➔ Web site
- [posts][row 108][text]: Cooperation ➔ Coöperation, Reemphasize ➔ Reëmphasize, smart quotes applied
```

### 5. Sync your website

With the changes made in the database, press the "Sync your website" button on Publii to push all changes to your live website.

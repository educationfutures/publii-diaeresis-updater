# Diaeresis and smart quotes updater for Publii

This Python script scans your [Publii](https://getpublii.com/) site's SQLite database and updates text inside posts to:

- Correctly apply **diaereses** (¬®) to appropriate words (e.g., `cooperate` ‚ûî `co√∂perate`)
- Optionally replace **straight quotes** with **smart (curly) quotes** (e.g., `"example"` ‚ûî `‚Äúexample‚Äù`)
- Correct common informal word usages (e.g., `webpage` ‚ûî `Web page`, `gonna` ‚ûî `going to`)

It ensures a more precise, formal, and polished English writing style across your site.

## Why use it?

Readers deserve beautiful and accurate type. Though the diaeresis (¬®) has largely fallen out of everyday use in modern English, it serves an important linguistic purpose: providing clarity in pronunciation by indicating where adjacent vowels should be separated into distinct syllables. Without it, words like ‚Äúcooperate‚Äù or ‚Äúreenter‚Äù may briefly confuse readers, who might misinterpret the structure of the word. Properly applied, the diaeresis preserves the rhythm, flow, and precision of English. While most publications have abandoned its use, [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com) has notably and bravely maintained the tradition, recognizing that careful attention to typography can enhance both the clarity and the beauty of language.

Similarly, replacing straight quotation marks with smart (curly) quotes enhances typographic quality and aligns your site with professional publishing standards.

This script allows you to make these corrections **automatically** across your Publii site.

## How it works

- Connects directly to your site's `db.sqlite` file.
- Scans the `posts` table, updating the `title` and `text` fields.
- Only words listed in the internal dictionary are replaced ‚Äî no uncontrolled edits.
- Optionally replaces straight quotes with properly matched opening/closing smart quotes.
- Supports **dry-run mode** to preview changes without modifying your database.
- Automatically creates a backup (`db.sqlite.bak`) unless disabled.

## Example

Before:

> Cooperation and "coordination" are key to reevaluating our plans.

After:

> Co√∂peration and ‚Äúco√∂rdination‚Äù are key to re√´valuating our plans.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important warning

**Please read carefully before using this tool.**

- Always make your own manual backup of your Publii site's `db.sqlite` file before running the script ‚Äî even though the script will automatically create a `.bak` copy.
- If used improperly or on the wrong file, the script could unintentionally modify your database.
- Always run a `--dry-run` first to preview the changes.
- Only proceed with full updates once you have verified the changes are safe and appropriate for your site.

**Use at your own risk.**
